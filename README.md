# Pandas Data Manipulation

#### -- Project Status: Completed

## Project Intro/Objective

This project's main objective is to demonstrate data manipulation and cleaning using the pandas library in Python.  One directory uses fictional vidoe game data while the other uses fictional school district data.  Jupyter notebooks were used to make the data processing interactive.  Both notebook files contain several insights from creating different data frames from the provided CSV files.
